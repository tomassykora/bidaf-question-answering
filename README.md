# bidaf-question-answering

Bi-directional Attention Flow (BiDAF) question answering model enhanced by multi-layer convolutional network character embeddings.

A project originally from [CS224n](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) (winter 2020), solved for Brno University of Technology, Faculty of Information Technologies, course [ZPJa](https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/13531/) - Natural Language Processing.

Based on the paper - [Bidirectional Attention Flow for Machine Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01603) (2018).
